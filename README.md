This is a Discord Bot that I created  for my server as I was learning how to use discord.py API wrapper. The Server is for book enthusiasts to chat about books they love. The bot helps in moderating the server, help users get book reviews by making several api calls to online book libraries, and does other useful tasks for both the users and the administraton.

Occasionally, I will be pushing changes to this repository as I learn more cool stuff that one can do using this API Wrapper.
That said, this is for learning, and only learning, purposes.
