This is a basic Discord Bot that I created as I was learning how to use discord.py API wrapper to create discord bots. 
Occasionally, I will be pushing changes to this repository as I learn cool stuff that one can do using this API Wrapper.
That said, this is for learning, and only learning, purposes.
